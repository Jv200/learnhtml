<!-- * every element has a default display value ,the two most common display values are inline and block elements -->
 <!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
  Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>. -->

<p> this is paragraph</p> <P> this is paragraph</P>
