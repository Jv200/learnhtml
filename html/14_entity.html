    <!--  reserved character ya tags ko agr content pe display krna hua toh kaise krnge? -->
      <!-- using character entity reference  -->
       <!-- & code ; -->
       <p> print the tag  &lt; img &gt; </p>

    <!-- In HTML, &amp; is used instead of & directly because & is a special character that starts an HTML entity. An HTML entity is a way to represent reserved characters in HTML so they don't get misinterpreted by the browser. Hereâ€™s why and how it works:

Why Use &amp; Instead of &
Special Character: In HTML, the & character is used to indicate the start of an entity reference.
 For example, &lt; represents the less-than sign < and &gt; represents the greater-than sign >.
Avoid Confusion: If you use & directly, the browser might think you are starting an entity reference and expect more characters to follow. This can cause errors or incorrect display of your content. -->
       

<p> for ampersand : &amp; <br>
    for  greater than :&gt; <br>
    for  less than :&lt; <br>
    for  double quotes :&quot; <br>
    for  apostrophe  :&apos;
